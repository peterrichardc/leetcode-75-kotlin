# LeetCode 75 Solutions in Kotlin

Welcome to my **LeetCode 75 Kotlin** repository! 🎉

This repository features solutions to the **LeetCode 75** problems, entirely implemented in **Kotlin**. The goal is to tackle each problem with clean, efficient, and optimized code. Whether you're brushing up on algorithms, preparing for coding interviews, or simply exploring Kotlin solutions, this repository provides a solid reference for solving a wide range of challenges.

The challenges can be found in the official **[LeetCode 75 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)**.

## 🚀 Progress

I am currently working on adding all the solutions, and new code will be uploaded shortly. Stay tuned!

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Topics**: Each folder represents a specific topic (e.g., Arrays - String, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, etc.).
- **Kotlin Files**: Each exercise is implemented in its own `.kt` file inside the corresponding topic folder.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary language for solving these problems.
- **LeetCode**: The platform where the challenges are hosted.
